        <h1>Seattle Public Life: Mapping Project </h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p> This project uses data from the Seattle Public Life Study to map changes in public life from 2018 to 2023. We looked at the distributio of race, gender, and age groups in different neighborhoods of Seattle.

        <h1> Ethics Statement </h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p> The main ethical issue with using the Seattle Public Life data is that “participants” in these 
            large datasets did not consent to being part of the study. The metadata document states that the 
            study “completed a Privacy Assessment through the City of Seattle IT Department” (page 3 of 
            metadata document).While this takes a legal route to ensuring participants’ privacy is not 
            disrupted, participants were never informed nor could consent to being recorded at the various 
            public locations in Seattle. As users of this public dataset, there is not much we can do to 
            change the beneficence or justice requirements laid out in Paxton (2020). However, we only 
            analyze the dataset by one demographic at a time, to reduce the chances of identifying specific 
            participants. </p>

        <p>As researchers, we have sought to represent participants’ unique experiences based on several 
            demographic variables: gender, race, and age. In earlier iterations of our graphs, we had simply 
            collapsed demographic variables into a single marker that only considered the largest subgroups 
            of participants (i.e., female-to-male ratio, underrepresented minority-to-White ratio). We 
            realized that this erased the experiences of non-binary people (for the gender variable) and 
            lumped all people of color into one group (for the race variable). Our group decided that 
            although it would significantly increase the number of visualizations our team produced, we 
            would create visualizations for the percentage of each subgroup throughout Seattle. This meant 
            creating maps for each level of the gender, race, and age variables - totaling 14 visualizations 
            instead of 3.</p>
